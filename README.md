# MailArchiver

March (MailArchiver) is a tool to search, sort and organize your email and either download it for archiving, or delete emails.
It is primarily focused on GMail (at least initially) and attempts to keep as much information from GMail as possible, such as thread structure, labels, etc. 
The aim is to allow you to download the email in varius organizations: date (year/month/day), labels, domains, etc.
That way you can organize your email archive any way you like, and free up space in gmail.
